Consider the following Haskell function, which argument is a stream of program threads and returns a Str of which thread should run. 
\begin{hscode}
    schedule :: Str [Threads] -> Str Thread
    schedule str1 str2 = ...
\end{hscode}
How would you test for the abscence of deadlock? In a schedule of multiple active threads a deadlock is observed if eventually only one thread is  always active. Though this is easy to formulate, this is actually very hard to check for in practice. But using QuickRattus, we could write:
\begin{hscode}
    prop_schedule_anyArguments_noDeadLock =
        satisfies
            schedule
            tautology
            Always (Eventually (SP (=="t0"))) `Or` Always (Eventually (SP (=="t1")))
\end{hscode}
